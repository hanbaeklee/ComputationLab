% When you use the code, please cite my paper 
% "A Dynamically Consistent Global Nonlinear Solution 
% Method in the Sequence Space and Applications."

This is the guideline of the solution code for the following model:
"Krusell and Smith (1998) with endogenous labor supply."

The package is composed of 
1) main file ('runner.m')
2) implementation files ('./maincodes')
3) functions ('./functions')
4) solution storage ('./solutions')
5) figure storage ('./figures')
6) model explanation ('./note')
